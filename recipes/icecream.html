    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>
        Vanilla ice cream is a sweet frozen dessert made from milk, cream, sugar, and vanilla flavoring from vanilla seeds, pure vanilla extract, vanilla seed paste, or a combination. As the quintessential center of ice cream sandwiches and the foundation of every classic hot fudge sundae, vanilla ice cream is fully customizable and flavorful enough to enjoy on its own.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can make vanilla ice cream using an ice cream machine or mix it by hand in stages over a few hours. There are simple four-ingredient recipes and old-fashioned frozen custards made with rich egg yolks—the key to all of them is the prevalence of real vanilla bean flavor.    
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    

    <ul>
        <li>2 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Stir milk, cream, and sugar in a saucepan over low heat until sugar has dissolved. Heat just until the mixture is hot and a small ring of foam appears around the edge.</p>
            
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Transfer cream mixture to a pourable container such as a large measuring cup. Stir in vanilla extract and chill mix thoroughly, at least 2 hours. (Overnight is best.)</p>
            
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pour cold ice cream mix into an ice cream maker, turn on the machine, and churn according to manufacturer's directions, 20 to 25 minutes.</p>
            
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>When ice cream is softly frozen, serve immediately or place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the ice cream and place in the freezer to ripen, 2 to 3 hours.</p>
